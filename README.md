### Hi there, I'm Onnwen 👋

I’m currently enrolled at the University of Milan “La Statale,” where I’m pursuing a degree in Computer Science & Communication. I recently completed my diploma in Computer Science and Telecommunications, which laid the foundation for my technical skills and knowledge. However, my academic background only scratches the surface of my interests and aspirations.

Presently, I work as an iOS Engineer at Iliad, where I apply the expertise I’ve developed through my studies and professional experiences. Alongside my role at Iliad, I also collaborate with Dario D’Angelo’s Blog, providing IT strategy advice and contributing to community engagement initiatives.

My journey reflects my openness to change and adaptability. Having grown up in France and moved to Italy at the end of elementary school, I’ve learned firsthand the importance of flexibility, open-mindedness, and the ability to adapt—qualities that are essential in our constantly evolving world.

Throughout my education, internships taught me the value of teamwork. It was within these teams that I honed my leadership skills, learning to recognize the right moments to step up, propose practical solutions during challenging times, and build consensus around those ideas.

Feel free to explore my repositories, where you’ll find projects that showcase my technical skills and interests. I’m always open to connecting with like-minded individuals and exploring new opportunities.
